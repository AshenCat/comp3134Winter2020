1.) The output does not show ben because ben is not active

2.) The output shows ben because of the trailing '-- which comments the rest of the line

3.) The injection doesn't work because the sql command would look like this:

where firstname='ben' or 1=1' and active=1

the command results to an error because of the extra single quote.
